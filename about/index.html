<h1 class="silver-text">Welcome to my page!</h1>

 <p>
  Hello, so you have clicked 1 of 2 links... and it has led you here.
  Unfortunately, I am still working this out, so please bear with me, but I too, am excited for what my site could become.
  I am currently still working on learning to code (polishing HTML and CSS skills!), but for now, please feel free to check out my newly formed <a href="http://mjfalcon.wordpress.com"> Wordpress site </a>, which I hope to start off but eventually translate onto here, along with create a domain.
 
  <div class="row">I like food, so please enjoy this photo of a salad: <img src="/imgs/salad4site.jpg" class="smaller-image"><br><br>
   Also, this is the reaction my SO had to me actually posting above photo: <img src="/imgs/Seansurprised.jpg" width="250" height="400"></div>
  See ya soon!
  </p>
